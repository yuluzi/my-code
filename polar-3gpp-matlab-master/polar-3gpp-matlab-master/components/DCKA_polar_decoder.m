% DCKA_POLAR_DECODER Distributed-CRC-and-Known-bit-Aided (DCKA) polar decoder.
%   a_hat = DCKA_POLAR_DECODER(e_tilde, crc_polynomial_pattern, crc_interleaver_pattern, info_bit_pattern, rate_matching_pattern, mode, L, min_sum, P2, a_tilde) 
%   decodes the encoded LLR sequence e_tilde, in order to obtain the
%   recovered information bit sequence a_hat.
%
%   e_tilde should be a real row vector comprising E number of Logarithmic
%   Likelihood Ratios (LLRS), each having a value obtained as LLR =
%   ln(P(bit=0)/P(bit=1)).
%
%   crc_polynomial_pattern should be a binary row vector comprising P+1
%   number of bits, each having the value 0 or 1. These bits parameterise a
%   Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) comprising P bits. Each bit provides the
%   coefficient of the corresponding element in the CRC generator
%   polynomial. From left to right, the bits provide the coefficients for
%   the elements D^P, D^P-1, D^P-2, ..., D^2, D, 1.
%
%   crc_interleaver_pattern should be a row vector comprising K number of
%   integers, each having a unique value in the range 1 to K. Each integer
%   identifies which one of the K information or CRC bits provides the 
%   corresponding bit in the input to the polar encoder kernal.
%
%   info_bit_pattern should be a row vector comprising N number of logical 
%   elements, each having the value true or false. The number of elements 
%   in info_bit_pattern having the value true should be K, where K = A+P. 
%   These elements having the value true identify the positions of the 
%   information and CRC bits within the input to the polar encoder kernal.
%
%   rate_matching_pattern should be a row vector comprising E number of
%   integers, each having a value in the range 1 to N. Each integer
%   identifies which one of the N outputs from the polar encoder kernal
%   provides the corresponding bit in the encoded bit sequence e.
%
%   mode should have the value 'repetition', 'puncturing' or 'shortening'.
%   This specifies how the rate matching has been achieved. 'repetition'
%   indicates that some outputs of the polar encoder kernal are repeated in 
%   the encoded bit sequence two or more times. 'puncturing' and 
%   'shortening' indicate that some outputs of the polar encoder kernal 
%   have been excluded from the encoded bit sequence. In the case of
%   'puncturing' these excluded bits could have values of 0 or 1. In the
%   case of 'shortening' these excluded bits are guaranteed to have values
%   of 0.
%
%   L should be a scalar integer. It specifies the list size to use during
%   Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding.
%
%   min_sum shoular be a scalar logical. If it is true, then the SCL
%   decoding process will be completed using the min-sum approximation.
%   Otherwise, the log-sum-product will be used. The log-sum-product gives
%   better error correction capability than the min-sum, but it has higher
%   complexity.
%
%   P2 should be a scalar integer. Although the CRC has P bits, only 
%   P-min(P2,log2(L)) of these are used for error detection. The remaining 
%   min(P2,log2(L)) of the CRC bits are used to improve error correction. 
%   So the CRC needs to be min(P2,log2(L)) number of bits longer than CRCs 
%   used in other codes, in order to achieve the same error detection 
%   capability.
%
%   a_tilde should be a row vector comprising A elements. Elements having
%   the value 0 or 1 indicate that the receiver has prior knowledge that
%   the corresponding information bit has the corresponding value. Elements
%   having any other value indicate that the receiver does not have prior
%   knowledge of the value of the corresponding information bit.
%
%   a_hat will normally be a binary row vector comprising A number of bits, 
%   each having the value 0 or 1. However, in cases where the CRC check 
%   fails, a_hat will be an empty vector.
